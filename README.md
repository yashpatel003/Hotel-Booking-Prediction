# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction System
Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction System**! This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict hotel booking cancellations. By forecasting cancellations in advance, hoteliers can optimize their operations, improve customer experience, and minimize revenue losses.

This system integrates MySQL for data ingestion and leverages Scikit-learn for model development, with a focus on automating data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the system as a foundation for your own machine learning applications!

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**: From data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Data Preprocessing Automation**: Scalable preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in logging and exception handling to monitor the system’s health.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model validation.

## Project Architecture

This project follows a modular approach where each component of the pipeline is separated into distinct scripts:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Connects to MySQL to fetch booking data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handles data cleaning, imputation, scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) for predicting cancellations.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Measures model performance and provides insights.
