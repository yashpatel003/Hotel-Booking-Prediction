# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction System
Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction System**! This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict hotel booking cancellations. By forecasting cancellations in advance, hoteliers can optimize their operations, improve customer experience, and minimize revenue losses.

This system integrates MySQL for data ingestion and leverages Scikit-learn for model development, with a focus on automating data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the system as a foundation for your own machine learning applications!

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**: From data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Data Preprocessing Automation**: Scalable preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in logging and exception handling to monitor the systemâ€™s health.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model validation.

## Project Architecture

This project follows a modular approach where each component of the pipeline is separated into distinct scripts:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Connects to MySQL to fetch booking data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handles data cleaning, imputation, scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) for predicting cancellations.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Measures model performance and provides insights.

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to install the project.
    - Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yashpatel003/Hotel-Booking-Prediction

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    - Move into the project folder:
        ```bash
        cd Hotel-Booking-Prediction

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
    - It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
        ```bash
        python -m venv hotel_env

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    - Activate the environment using the following command:
        1. On Windows:
            ```bash
            hotel_env\Scripts\activate
        
        2. On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source hotel_env/bin/activate
      

5. **Install Dependencies**
    - Install all required Python libraries and packages using the requirements.txt file:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt

6. **Set Up MySQL Database**
    - Before running the pipeline, ensure that your MySQL database is set up with the hotel booking data.
    - Create a database in MySQL (e.g., hotel_booking).
    - Import the hotel booking dataset into a table (e.g., bookings).
    - Update the database credentials in the data_ingestion.py file.

7. **Run the Project**
    - Start the project by running the  command.
        ```bash
        python app.py
